## `.gitignore` in the `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` folder

If you're changing any pre-commit hooks, note that `.gitignore` can be different to
`{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/.gitignore`. This includes which folders, and files are
excluded.

It's strongly recommended that you build an example project to test out your changes.
